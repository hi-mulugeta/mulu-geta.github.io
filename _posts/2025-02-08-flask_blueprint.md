# Lesson Plan: Flask Blueprints

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, students will understand the concept of **Flask Blueprints**, their advantages, and how to implement them in a Flask application to achieve better code organization and modularity.

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Introduction to Flask Blueprints

- What are Blueprints?
- Why use Blueprints?
- Real-world analogy (e.g., different sections of a company: HR, Sales, Tech, each managing its own operations but contributing to a single organization)

### 2. Setting Up a Flask Project with Blueprints

- Install Flask
- Create a Flask application structure with Blueprints

### 3. Implementing Blueprints

- Define a Blueprint
- Register a Blueprint in the main application
- Using templates and static files with Blueprints
- Communicating between Blueprints

### 4. Advanced Concepts

- Middleware with Blueprints
- Error handling in Blueprints
- Blueprint-specific configurations
- Testing Blueprints with `pytest`
- Deployment considerations
- Common mistakes & debugging techniques
- Using Blueprints in large-scale applications
- Deployment with WSGI servers (Gunicorn, uWSGI)

### 5. Practical Example

- Create a simple multi-module Flask application
- Example: A blog application with `auth` and `posts` modules

### 6. Testing and Debugging

- Running the application
- Debugging common errors with Blueprints

### 7. Summary & Recap

- Key takeaways
- Q&A session

# Study Notes: Flask Blueprints

## What Are Flask Blueprints?

Flask Blueprints allow us to organize a Flask application into reusable modules. Instead of defining all routes in a single file, we can create separate modules for different functionalities and then register them with the main application.

### Defining a Blueprint

```python
from flask import Blueprint

# Define the Blueprint
auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')

# Define a route inside the Blueprint
@auth_bp.route('/login')
def login():
    return "Login Page"
```

### Registering a Blueprint

In `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask
from auth import auth_bp

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(auth_bp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## How Blueprints Communicate

1. **Using **``** for Cross-Blueprint Routing**

```python
from flask import url_for

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return f"Go to <a href='{url_for('auth.login')}'>Login</a>"
```

2. **Shared Context with **``** and **``

```python
from flask import g

@auth_bp.before_request
def load_user():
    g.user = "Current User"
```

3. **Calling Functions Between Blueprints**

```python
from auth import some_function

@posts_bp.route("/posts")
def posts():
    return some_function()
```

4. **Using Application Configurations**

```python
app.config['CUSTOM_SETTING'] = 'value'
```

## Common Mistakes & Debugging Techniques

1. **Circular Imports** – Avoid importing the `app` instance inside a Blueprint module.
2. **Missing **`` – If a Blueprint doesn’t have a URL prefix, conflicting routes may arise.
3. **Incorrect Registration** – Ensure Blueprints are correctly registered in `app.py`.
4. **Middleware Conflicts** – Middleware should be placed in the correct scope to avoid affecting all Blueprints unintentionally.

### Using Blueprints in Large-Scale Applications

For a scalable application, consider breaking it into multiple Blueprints:

```plaintext
/my_large_app/
│── app.py
│── config.py
│── /modules/
│   │── /users/
│   │   │── __init__.py
│   │   │── routes.py
│   │── /orders/
│   │   │── __init__.py
│   │   │── routes.py
│   │── /products/
│   │   │── __init__.py
│   │   │── routes.py
│── /templates/
│── /static/
```

Each module operates as a separate Blueprint and can be maintained independently.

### Deployment with WSGI Servers

For production deployment, Flask applications using Blueprints should be served with a WSGI server like **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI**.

#### **Deploying with Gunicorn**

Install Gunicorn:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Run the Flask app with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

This runs the Flask app with **4 worker processes** for better concurrency.

#### **Deploying with uWSGI**

Install uWSGI:

```bash
pip install uwsgi
```

Run the Flask app with uWSGI:

```bash
uwsgi --http :8000 --wsgi-file app.py --callable app --processes 4 --threads 2
```

## Summary

- Blueprints help structure Flask applications into smaller, modular components.
- Middleware, error handling, and testing can be applied specifically to Blueprints.
- Debugging techniques help prevent common issues like circular imports and middleware conflicts.
- Large-scale applications should be structured using multiple Blueprints.
- Deployment should use WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI for better performance.

# Flashcards: Flask Blueprints

**Flashcard 1**\
Q: What is a Flask Blueprint?\
A: A Flask Blueprint is a way to organize routes, templates, and static files into reusable modules for better project structure.

**Flashcard 2**\
Q: How do you define a Blueprint in Flask?\
A: `Blueprint(name, __name__, url_prefix='/prefix')`

**Flashcard 3**\
Q: How can Blueprints communicate?\
A: `url_for`, shared context (`g`), function calls, app configurations.

**Flashcard 4**\
Q: How do you register a Blueprint in Flask?\
A: Use `app.register_blueprint(your_blueprint)` in `app.py`.
